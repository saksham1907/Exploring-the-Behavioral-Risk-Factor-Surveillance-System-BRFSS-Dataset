# Exploring-the-Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-Dataset
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a survey system which collects information from various states in US to measure to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older).The survey is carried either by landline telephonic interviews or through cellular phone interviews.In conducting telephone based interview, the data is collected by randomly selecting an adult from a household while in cellular phone interview data is collected from an adult who has a cellular phone and lives either in private residence or college housing.

Thus data collected from both landline telephonic interview and celluar phone interview are case of simple random sampling since each individual is equally likely to be selected from the population.Also the sample is representative of population since the data is collected from 4,91,775 observations which are large enough to represent the sample.

Hence data collected in this system is part of observational study instead of experimental which randomly assign subjects to treatment to estabilish causal connections between explanatory and response variable.And since it is observational study, data colleted from obsevations can be analysed to see if there is any kind of correlation between explanatory and response variable.Correlation does not imply caustaion and so we conclude that the results are generalizable.
